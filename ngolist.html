<p>
Give people medical support without any discrimination of race, religion, political, gender. I personally like their emergency rescue activities because they rescue people in dangerous situations or rescue Refugees in danger. They also provide medical support. However they have record which employees who have been accused of sexual harassment. Therefore my recommendation rate would be 3 out of 5
</p>

<b><a href="https://www.goodneighbors.kr/" target = "_blink">굿네이버스 </a></b><br>
<font size = "2" color = "white">https://www.goodneighbors.kr/</font><br>
<p>
Good neighbors investigate outer, inner poverty issues and support the low sallary or the poor. I recommend good neighbors because we can point out one child and support him/her. Every year, we can get Child Growth and Development Report and letter from child. We can know how his/her life get better than before.

<font size = "2" color = "white">https://www.worldvision.or.kr/</font> <br>
<p>
It help the children, families and communities out of poverty and fight against inequality. They does not support people directly, but they support all the money in Regional development business. Because of this reason, I personally think this world vision has low credibility because spending on Regional development business might used in corrupted way. 
</p>

One Tree Planted get a Platinum Seal of Transparency by GuideStar. This is highest rank held by organizations that share all their results and progress. This reveals that this organization use our money in right place which is plating trees. I really recommend this organization because organization is credible and it has great impact by planting 23 million trees.

They are founded for the civilian safety. for now they are having donation to the poor people and multicultural family. I recommend this web site because this organization get Consultative Status from ECOSOC.

Korean make a wish is a organization which helps child who get incurable disease. I highly recommend this organization because here got “Best” on clarity of accounting part to Korean Government. Moreover, this organization is working in global wide including Asia, Europe, America, and Oceania. There are system called Wish journey. This system is why I highly recommend this ngo because each child who got incurable disease make a wish such as “I want to be a firefighter”, then organization give them a opportunity to experience those wishes.
